<hr>
First of all, a window is created.
<pre>
  KXL_CreateWindow(100, 100, "sample"
                   KXL_EVENT_EXPOSURE_MASK |
                   KXL_EVENT_KEY_PRESS);
</pre>
It is a setup that this is window of the size of width 100 and height
100, display it on a title bar as "sample", and it receives re-drawing
and key press as an event. At this time, pixmap (referred to as
frame below) of the same size is created. Once it does not draw
directly to window fundamentally but draws on a frame, a frame is made
to reflect in window.
<br><br>

Next, an event is received.
<pre>
  while(KXL_CheckEvents()){
    switch(KXL_GetEvents()){
    case KXL_EVENT_EXPOSE: // event of re-drawing
          :
    case KXL_EVENT_KEY_PRESS: // event of key press
          :
    }
  }
</pre>
It is confirmed whether the event occurred in KXL_CheckEvents(). If
anything does not have an event, it will escape from while. If an
event occurs, it will investigate which event it is by
KXL_GetEvents().
<br><br>

Event of Re-drawing(KXL_EVENT_EXPOSE) If it generates, a thing required
for a frame will be drawn. The whole frame is cleared first.
<pre>
  KXL_ClearFrameImm(0, 0, 100, 100);
</pre>
A frame is cleared here (the left 0, top 0, width 100, height 100).
<br><br>

A character sequence will be drawn if a frame is cleared.
<pre>
  KXL_PutText(30,50, "sample");
</pre>
The character which this calls to the left as 30 from the upper left
  of a frame, and calls "sample" below in the position of 50 is
  drawn. A default font set
"-adobe-courier-bold-r-normal--14-*-*-*-*-*-iso8859-1 " Coming out,
  the color has become white.
<br><br>

If drawing to a frame finishes, a frame is made to reflect in a
window.
<pre>
  KXL_UpDateImm(0, 0, 100, 100);
</pre>
A frame (the left 0, top 0, width 100, height 100) is transmitted to a window here.
<br><br>

Event of key press(KXL_EVENT_KEY_PRESS) If it generates, it will
judge which key was pushed.
<pre>
  if (KXL_GetKey() == KXL_KEY_Return)
    flag = True;
</pre>
KXL_GetKey() The key come out of and pushed is acquired and it is a
return key. KXL_KEY_Return True will be set to flag if it becomes. It
escapes from a loop now.
<br><br>

Finally a window is closed.
<pre>
  KXL_DeleteWindow();
</pre>
